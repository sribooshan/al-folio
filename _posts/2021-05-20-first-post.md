description: My first blog post!

I never thought I would create a website for myself. Thanks to <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mshediva/" target="blank">Maruan Al-Shedivat</a>! His simple and neat academic theme named <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio" target="blank">al-folio</a> encouraged me to create one.

I plan to write my thoughts here on this <a href="https://sribooshan.github.io/blog/" target="blank">blog</a> every month, based on my schedule. Look out! Thanks for reading.

Please feel free me to email me if you think I can be of any help to you!

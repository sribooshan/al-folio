Our group, Integrated Systems Lab, at Anna University submitted three design proposals for the IEEE SSCS PICO Design Contest (Link: https://sscs.ieee.org/about/solid-state-circuits-directions/sscs-pico-design-contest), the first of its kind contest. And all three got selected! 

***

Our group is spearheaded by Prof. Dr. P. V. Ramakrishna and Dr. J. Dhurga Devi and we have three PhD students and eighteen undergrad students. We are also generously and cheerfully supported by our group alumni, especially Mr. Baburaj Thillaigovindan (MBit Wireless) and Mr. Jayakumar.

#### Our submissions
<ul>
    <li>Design of a GPS Baseband Engine (Link: https://efabless.com/projects/344)</li>
    <li>Polysilicon Resistor-based Temperature Sensor (Link: https://efabless.com/projects/324)</li>
    <li>Oscillator based read-out circuit for LVDTs (Link: https://efabless.com/projects/337)</li>
</ul>

We will be using Skywater Technology's 130nm process (with opensource pdk: <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk" target="blank">skywater-pdk</a>) and opensource EDA tools. I will write a detailed blog post elaborating the tools used, the shuttle program through which our design will be fabricated, etc.

Hello there, I'm Booshan! 

I'm currently a **Digital IC Design Engineer** at <a href="https://www.maxlinear.com" target="blank">MaxLinear</a> in the SoC Design Team in Chennai, India.

Previously, I worked as a Mixed-Signal Verification Engineer at <a href="https://ixana.ai" target="blank">Ixana</a>, a deep-tech startup which aims to revolutionize human-computer interaction! The company was in super-stealth mode until November 2022.

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from CEG, Anna University. I consider it an inexplicable privilege to say that I spent most of my undergrad time at the Integrated Systems Lab (ISL) under Prof. P. V. Ramakrishna and Dr. J. Dhurga Devi. 

If you think I can be of any help to you, please feel free to email me - firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.

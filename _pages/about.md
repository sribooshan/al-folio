Hello there, I'm Booshan! 

I'm currently a **Digital IC Design Engineer** at <a href="https://www.maxlinear.com" target="blank">MaxLinear</a> in the SoC Design Team in Chennai, India.

Previously, I worked as a Mixed-Signal Verification Engineer at <a href="https://ixana.ai" target="blank">Ixana</a>, a deep-tech startup which aims to revolutionize human-computer interaction! The company was in super-stealth mode until November 2022.

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from CEG, Anna University. I consider it an inexplicable privilege to say that I spent most of my undergrad time at the Integrated Systems Lab (ISL) under Prof. P. V. Ramakrishna and Dr. J. Dhurga Devi.

An avid listener of Indian classical music (especially the South Indian form - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music" target="blank">Carnatic music</a>), I do try to sing sometimes when my voice seems to co-operate with me. 

If you think I can be of any help to you, please feel free to email me - firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.

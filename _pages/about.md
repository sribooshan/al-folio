Hello there, I'm Booshan! 

I'm a final-year undergrad studying Electronics and Communication Engineering at CEG, Anna University.

I consider it an inexplicable privilege that I spend most of my time at the Integrated Systems Lab (ISL) under Prof. P. V. Ramakrishna and Dr. J. Dhurga Devi. We are involved in projects with a wide range of areas including but not limited to integrated circuit design studies, estimation theory, wireless communication and radar systems.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](https://sribooshan.github.io/assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

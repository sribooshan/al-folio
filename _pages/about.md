Hello there, I'm Booshan! 

I'm currently a Mixed-Signal IC Design Engineer in a US-based startup operating in a super-stealth mode. Stay tuned, we're working on something quite exciting!

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from CEG, Anna University. I consider it an inexplicable privilege to say that I spent most of my undergrad time at the Integrated Systems Lab (ISL) under Prof. P. V. Ramakrishna and Dr. J. Dhurga Devi. I was involved in projects with a wide range of areas including but not limited to analog/mixed-signal/digital integrated circuit design, estimation theory, wireless communication system design and radar systems. Our lab got three designs selected in the IEEE SSCS PICO Design Contest in August 2021 and we are heading towards tapeout! (See <a href="https://sribooshan.github.io/news/announcement_3/" target="blank">here</a> for more details.)

If you think I can be of any help to you, please feel free to email me - firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.
